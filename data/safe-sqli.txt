" Other places hoping sell concept wary public devices , less "

" So , non-story , "
 And one long tooth become fossilised: I first heard &quot; independence means passport controls &quot; canard least 40 years ago
 Yet interesting point lost retelling whiskery old tale
" Why independent Scotland expected Europe &apos;s bidding , anyway ? Why trade London &apos;s yoke Brussels , especially ? Here real European news: great , post-war plan unite Europe finally stalled "
" With euro crisis , Project Europe officially dead "
" Across EU , parties dedicated opposing EU , scrapping euro common currency , gaining ground "
" Even Germany , Eurosceptic Alternative Germany Party - founded year - came nowhere grab nearly five million votes September &apos;s federal elections , thus effectively knocking Free Democrats (equivalent Lib Dems) Bundestag "
 There always domestic opposition plan create federal Europe
" However , current economic crisis proved watershed "

 The crisis euro little national governments running excessive budget deficits - true Greece
" Rather , euro system locked members exchange rates favourable German exporters - something German politicians want keep "

" But Berlin longer needs Paris passport political legitimacy imposed economic policy Europe , leaving battered French economy struggling "
" Result: Marine Le Pen &apos;s right-wing , anti-EU National Front crucial by-election , knocking ruling Socialists third place "

" What Le Pen newfound popularity among French white , working class ? She wants use next year &apos;s EU elections create anti-EU , anti-common currency bloc across European Parliament "
" If , possible , anti-EU parties well elections , bloc could dominate European Parliament first time "
 Here &apos;s point: sometime soon growing anti-EU anti-common currency feeling Europe coalesce kill euro
